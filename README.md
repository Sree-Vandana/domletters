# domletters â€” count dominant letters
Sree Vandana Nadipalli and Bart Massey 2021

This repository contains a program that counts dominant
letters in alphabetic words of an ASCII text, present in a '.txt' file. The file name is read from
standard input, and total count is printed on standard output.

An "alphabetic word" is any sequence of one or more
ASCII letters (`a`-`z` and/or `A`-`Z`) surrounded by
whitespace. For example

    This isn't an "incomplete sentence". Really
    not.

contains just three words: `This`, `an` and `Really`.

The "dominant letter count" of a word is the maximum number of
times that a given letter appears in the word, treating
upper and lowercase letters as equivalent. Examples:

* The dominant letter count of `any` is 1, since the most any
  letter appears is once.

* The dominant letter count of `bookkeeper` is 3, since `e`
  appears three times.

* The dominant letter count of `Arable` is 2, since `a`
  appears twice (once uppercase, once lowercase).

## Run the program
* Python Execution

To run the program in terminal,
1. In Windows, say

        python domletter-count.py input.txt

2. In Linux, say

        python3 domletter-count.py input.txt

where `input.txt` is the input file to be processed.

## Example

When run using the file `sentence.txt` in this distribution,
the program will produce a dominant letter count of **20**. When
run on `swift.txt` it will produce **71**. When run on `example.txt` it will produce **38**.
